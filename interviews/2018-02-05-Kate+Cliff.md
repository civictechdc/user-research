## Notes

First-Timer
JS developer

- wasn't quite sure what to expect and came to check it out
- discovery: meetup.com, twitter(Kate), word-of-mouth from other meetups
- first heard last summer
- had a free night so came to check it out, time-contraints before
- has been to other meetups: code newbie, reactDC, etc
  - tries to see what the style and vibe of other meetups 
  - ie networking, working group, etc, 
  - sees code for dc as a mix between networking and working on projects
  
- precived code for dc as more data science focused ( which seemed a little intimidating ) 
  - mid-level skill  seemed 'required', seemed like it would be harder for newbie to jump in 
- no expections as far a vibe or what to type of activites

- would have liked to have known how diverse the projects are 
- would tell a friend no matter what type of project you wanted to work on, you could find it 
  - experiance not a barrier 

- went to website briefly while here tonight 
  - expected to see schudule for meetups 
  
## walk through 

- would  got to meetup page to see next meeting
- current meetup date wasn't readily seen 
- would like to see a recurring schudule 
  - currently requires you to subscribe  
  - would like to just see it on the website
  - whats the usual schudule?
    - great if listed, but would be bad if it wasnt honored 
- nothing 'missing', 'its ok' 
  - noticed a little friction searching for where information was, even when it was where it was expected
   - (suspect sizing maybe and issue) 

- went to contact page for help with issues 
  - also checkout out link on front page
  - sending messages to individuals if needed 
  
- 'I don't think its nearly as bad as you think it is' 
  - 'its infomative'
  - 'had I gone throught the website beforehand I might have come sooner'
    - may have led to less intimidation
