## Notes

How would you find out what the current projects are?

- I would probably google “Code for DC”
- Click on projects
- I guess I could look through here
- “I don’t know why it’s loading so much” (why loading for so long)

How would you find when the next hack night is?

- I’d google “Code for DC”
- Look under the “Hack!” header, can’t find anything
- There’s a “Next Meeting” spot
- I’d click the Meetup link

How would you find out if Code for DC has a code of conduct?
- I would probably google “Code for DC code of conduct”
- “If I was specifically looking for it, I’d probably type it in”
