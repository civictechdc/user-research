## Notes

Where did you hear about Code for DC? What was described?

- No familiarity with Code for DC besides being a host for iStrategy labs

What do you think code for DC is?

- A place to collaborate on projects that benefit the community, for philanthropic causes, or something not-for-profit

How would you try to find out about a code for dc?

- Google search for “code4dc” I would assume it’s a dot org. I would think about hack but click on Attend. See that I’m supposed to go to Meetup. Click on Hack. After I’ve read that , navigate back to Attend and click on the meetup link. Sign in to RSVP. I wouldn’t use the google calendar feature. I wouldn’t use the discuss feature. Now that I see the project list I probably would have liked to go to that first, but I see it now and will quickly review those.

How would you find out what the current projects are?

- Search fo Code for dc, click on hack, then projects. Might look at the category filters to see what’s going on.
