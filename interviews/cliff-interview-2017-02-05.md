## Takeaways

Despite feeling the effects of imposter syndrome and not feeling like he was adequate enough to contribute initially, he sees that all coding experience levels are welcome. It would be nice to have active projects listed more prominently.

## Notes

### How many times have you been to code for dc?

Second time

### when was the first project you've worked on?

came last month

### what project have you worked on

improving the website

### what do you do during the day

student at GA

### do you use the same skills at GA

different skills so far, but he have a design background so not too different

### where did you hear about cfdc?

meetup.com

### did you have any initial thoughts when you saw it on meetup.com

He was looking for different meetups to join that are coding based. open and grassroots-y using whatever sills you had to improve the city. transplant. try to get more involved in the community

### have you been to any other meetups

yes, codenewbie and dc code and coffee

### when did you find out about code for dc

maybe a year and a half ago

### was there anything putting you off from coming

didn't feel like he knew enough. some freelance on the side but mostly design. didn't feel like he could contribute

### so what got you to come last month?

He had gotten a bit more coding skills under belt, worked on projects. he decided to go to a bunch more meetups

### what excited you about coming?

digging into apis and working on projects that were self directed

### what kind of skills did you think you needed

backend web dev - ruby/python

### what did you expect the skill level to be

not where he was. always above that. intermediate

### where did you get that vibe

the projects that were most committed to on github

### what did you expect when you showed up the first time

not sure. kind of projects that were already underway. floating around hoping somebody would need something. since it was new year, hopefully there would be open spots

### looking back to when you first saw code for dc, is there anything you wished you had known

skill level was broader than the projects. even though there were a lot of code for projects that were presented in project view, even though it was on the site. what types of languages.

### what made you come back

Hefelt like he could contribute even though he is still self concious about skill level. greg made him feel welcome. like he could help no matter what skills he had

### what would you tell a friend

it's a lot of fun. you can help with other people's projects. learn new things doesn't matter where you are. if you have an idea you can find help

### have you used the website

yes

### why?

what kinds of projects are people working on

### what were good things

links to github, wiki, the basic info he needed

### what were frustrating

hard to tell how active the projects were. A lot more going on than the project page would seem

### did you find info you were looking for

yes

### how can you get involved in a project, what projects are going on?

sort project by age
everything is > 2 years. don't know if this started two years ago or people haven't worked on it in that long. initially all commits on first are 2016

### what questions would you have to have in order to understand if you want to work on a project?

what they need help with
languages/tech stack (is listed)
if they need more people
nice to know what kind of non-tech needs they have especially for people not familiar with github
how helpful is this page in terms of answering if you would want to work on a project
gives an idea of what projects people are working on
not sure if it would help you to actually join a project

### how would you go about learning whether a project had open tasks

open issues?
start looking through github
not comfortable not having been here and just going to github to work on stuff
get an idea what's needed, but code related
if new or had other skills that weren't programming he wouldn't know if he could jump in - lot of questions that the meetup could solve
